# Java Food Delivery Application

This repository contains a **Food Delivery Application** built with Java and XML. The project provides a foundational structure for an online food ordering and delivery system, suitable for learning, demonstration, and further development.

## Overview

The application enables users to browse restaurant menus, place orders, and manage deliveries through a Java-based interface. It is designed to illustrate the core concepts of building a food delivery system, including order management, user interaction, and (optionally) backend logic.

## Features

- Browse restaurants and menus
- Add items to cart and place orders
- Track order status
- Basic user registration and login
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** Main application logic and user interface
- **XML:** UI layout and configuration (if using JavaFX or Android)
- (Add more details here if other frameworks/libraries are used, e.g., JavaFX, Swing, SQLite, etc.)
